{"name":"Garter - Google Analytics Realtime Dashboard","tagline":"A simple dashboard to monitor realtime traffic across multiple Google Analytics profiles","body":"##GARTER\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nGoogle Analytics web interface does not allows users to monitor realtime traffic from multiple Google Analytics profiles on a single screen. Garter was created in hope to alleviate this problem.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ndnhat/garter.git\r\ncd garter\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\nGarter requires a number of environment variables:\r\n```\r\nGA_USER=your_google_analytics_username\r\nGA_PASSWORD=your_google_analytics_password\r\nGA_PROFILE_IDS=comma_separated_profile_ids\r\nGA_PROFILE_NAME=comma_separated_profile_names\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, you may need to go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com) to increase the Analytics API setting for \"Per User Limit\". It is recommended to change the limit to 10 requests/second/user. \r\n\r\nGoogle also impose a 50,000 requests/day for most Analytics API developers. By default, Garter will query the Google Analytics API once every minute for each profile id provided which translates to 1440 requests/profile/day. \r\n\r\n### Credits\r\nGarter is made possible by a number of great open-source tools:\r\n\r\n* [expressjs](http://expressjs.com)\r\n* [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/)\r\n* [node-googleanalytics](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node-googleanalytics)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
